# 8ball
Ask all of lifes questions and you shall recieve an answer
## How-To
This really does not pass a whole lot at the moment. It is more of a proxy where you throw a quesiton at it, it ignores it, then gives a randomized response.
## Example Code
```
from EightBall.eightball import eightball

object = input('Whats your question peasent? ')
print(eightball.balls('helo'))
****************************************************
OUTPUT: 
Whats your question peasent? Am i alive
Outlook good

Process finished with exit code 0
```
